# Exercise Tracker and Counter using MediaPipe and OpenCV

This project utilizes the MediaPipe library along with OpenCV to detect human poses in real-time from a webcam feed and count exercises such as push-ups and squats.

## Features

- Real-time pose detection using the MediaPipe library.
- Counting of push-ups, squats, and other exercises based on pose analysis.
- Visual feedback on the screen displaying pose landmarks and exercise counts.
- Video recording capability to save the exercise session.
- Audio feedback for exercise counts.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
```

## Usage

1. Run the script:

```bash
python pose_detection.py
```

2. Make sure your webcam is connected and positioned properly.

3. Perform exercises in front of the webcam, and the program will count them accordingly.

4. Press 'q' to quit the program.

## Configuration

- You can adjust the confidence thresholds for pose detection (`min_detection_confidence` and `min_tracking_confidence`) inside the script according to your requirements.
